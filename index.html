                    <p>Hi! My name is Tyler Fielding and im a trainee junior developer from Bristol, United Kingdom. I am still currently learning code but this webiste is a little showcase for my progress and development of my coding skills.</p><br>
                    <p>Im recently new to coding but i have always been interested in technology and the way computer's work so coding is great for me. Coding can be challenging with all the diffrent languages but its not as hard as what you may think, once understood like any language its easier to know and use for many many things in which you'll see with my projects.</p><br>
                    <p>In my spare time i like to chill and watch films and binge watch netflix/amazon prime with my partner and i like to workout in my spare time also i like to learn things about coding and other things online but now im coding i now end up visually disecting websites to see how they work.</p>
